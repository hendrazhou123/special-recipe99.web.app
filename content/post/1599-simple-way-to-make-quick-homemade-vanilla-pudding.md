recipeingredient:
- "2 cups whole milk"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "3 large egg yolks beaten"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 tbsp. cornstarch"
- "1/8 tsp. salt"
- "1 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "2 tsp. pure vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together the beaten egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt....it will be pretty lumpy, but that&#39;s fine. Set it aside. Place the milk and cream into a large pot over medium heat. Let it heat to a simmer, stirring often, but do not let it come to a boil. Once it begins to simmer, remove it from the heat."
- "Slowly add in 1 cup of the heated milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking constantly to temper the eggs. Once it&#39;s all whisked together, whisk the egg mixture back into the pot of heated milk and return it to the burner. Now, cook this mixture over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring nearly constantly, until it is nice and thick."
- "Once thickened, remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the butter. Once it&#39;s melted in, stir in the vanilla extract. Now run the pudding through a fine mesh sieve with a rubber spatula to remove any lumps and to get the smoothest pudding."
- "At this point, either keep it in the bowl you strained it into or separate it into individual serving cups. Either way, you&#39;re going to cover the pudding with plastic wrap. You want to press the plastic wrap lightly onto the surface of the pudding, to prevent a skin from forming."
- "Let it chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving. Then eat it plain or top with some yummy toppings (pictured here with chocolate curls and banana slices). It&#39;ll last up to 3 days in the fridge."
