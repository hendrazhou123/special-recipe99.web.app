Vanilla cake with strawberry icing is my favorite flavor and this one is so beautiful! Gorgeously light and spongey vegan vanilla cupcakes topped with creamy strawberry vanilla frosting. Cupcakes are so easy they&#39;re my new favorite thing. So much easier than full cakes (though I love making cakes!), because they bake in less time and you.
