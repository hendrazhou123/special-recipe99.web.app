There are several possible explanations behind this. You may have added too much or too little baking soda, or maybe your baking soda has already gone bad. Baking is an exact science, so little mishaps like this could be detrimental to your bread! I firmly believe that banana bread is something you should be able to make anytime and anywhere, with a mixer or with a fork, in a loaf pan or in a muffin tin â€” whenever you have a few bananas going soft and freckly. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.
