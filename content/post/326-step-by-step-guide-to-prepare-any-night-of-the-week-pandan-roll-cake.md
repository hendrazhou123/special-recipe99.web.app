- "500 ml water"
- " Cake"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "40 g caster sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "To make the pandan extract, chop pandan leaves and place in a food processor with 500ml cool water."
- "Blend till finely chopped and strain the liquid with a muslin bag into a glass jar. Place the juice in the fridge overnight. The concentrated extract will settle at the bottom. Only this layer is used, the top layer of diluted pandan water can be discarded. You should get 50mls of concentrated extract."
- "The next day, make the cake. Preheat your oven to 200C fan setting. Line a 28cm x 28cm tray with baking parchment."

- "Fold the meringue into the egg yolk mixture in three batches, mixing until just incorporated."
- "Pour batter into the prepared tin. Drop the tin onto the counter to get rid of small air bubbles. Bake for 15mins. Remove from the oven. Remove the cake from the cake tin immediately onto a tea towel. Peel the parchment paper off. Roll the cake before the cake cools down to prevent too much cracking on the top. Let the cake cool completely, rolled up."
