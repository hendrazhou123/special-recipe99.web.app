recipeingredient:
- "1 standard measuring cup Chana flour"
- "1 and a 14 cups water"
- " Salt"
- "1 tsp Ajwain carom seeds"
- "1 Green chilli more or less depending on your taste"
- "1 tsp garlic paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine chana flour, garlic green chillies paste and salt. Add a little water at a time and stir until you get a smooth batter."
- "The batter should be slightly thinner than bhajiya batter. To prepare tava for pudla, first fry rotli/bread/Bhakhri with a little oil. This step helps to heat tava evenly so the pudla do not stick to the tava."
- "Pour a tsp oil on tava. Pour a serving spoon full of batter when the oil heats up. Spread it evenly using the spoon or by moving pan around."
- "Cook till the top surface dries up. Flip it, pour some oil all around, flip again and pour oil on the other side too."
- "Ensure even cooking by moving the pan over the flame frequently. Cook it evenly on both the sides. Prepare all the pudlas likewise. Serve hot with coriendar chutney and/or tomato ketchup."
- "Note: you may add water upto 2 more tbsp to this batter if you want pudla thinner than this."
- "Tips and cautions :1.Ensure to maintain the right consistency of the batter. Too thick batter will make pudlas thick as it won&#39;t be easy to spread it. Too thin batter will have pudla that burns, but not get cooked from inside. They will also break as you flip. 2. Consistency can always be corrected by adding more water or flour as needed."
- "3. If you are using iron pan, make sure that you shallow fry Bhakhri/rotli/bread or even onion or potato on it before you start making pudlas. This way the pudla will not stick to the pan. Make the first pudlo in iron tawa is very small to confirm if the pan is ready. 4. This is the simplest recipe of pudla. You may add grated onions/cucumber, chopped methi/coriendar and so on."
- "5. Ensure that the oil is hot before you pour batter on tava. Hot oil helps to form air bubbles on pudla. Without the air bubbles, the texture of pudla will be the same as Bhakhri and it won&#39;t taste nice."
