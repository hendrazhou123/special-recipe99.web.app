recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients together and stir well. If you have something you can shake it in, thats even better. So if you want a blended chocolate milk, put in a blender with 2 handfuls of ice and blend. Its so good blended and not that sweet. Perfect taste and refreshing. Loooove this."

If u want it sweeter add more sugar or vanilla. I have a ninja blender that came with the nutri bullet cups and i used those to blend myself one. But that only fits one handful of ice and a tiny more. But still great. Thank u for trying. I made this up."
