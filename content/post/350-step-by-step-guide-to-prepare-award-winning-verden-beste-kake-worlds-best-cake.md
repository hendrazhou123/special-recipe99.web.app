It&#39;s called verdens beste in Norway -- I didn&#39;t give it the name, it actually won a national cake competition years and years ago. Layers of moist sponge, light and crisp meringue, almonds, and heavenly vanilla cream come together into something really. The recipe for this cake, adapted from &#34;Sweet&#34; by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh, first appeared in an article written about Ms Goh when she ran her cafe, the Mortar &amp; Pestle, in Melbourne, Australia Rather intimidatingly for her, the headline for the article was &#34;World&#39;s Best Chocolate Cake.&#34; Cakes are simply the best.
