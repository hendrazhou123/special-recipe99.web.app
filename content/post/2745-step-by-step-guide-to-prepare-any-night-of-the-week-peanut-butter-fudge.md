Peanut butter fudge has always been a tradition in our family, but when my great-grandmother died, the recipe was lost. Of all the recipes I have tried, this tastes the closest to what she made. I do not add the peanut butter to the boiling mixture, I boil the sugar/milk on medium/high until it reaches soft ball. Peanut butter fudge is a sweet, nutty, and creamy confection made with peanut butter (of course!). It gets pressed into a pan, and then once it&#39;s cooled it can be cut into little cubes.
