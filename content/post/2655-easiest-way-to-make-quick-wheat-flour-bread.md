This bread recipe is easiest with a stand mixer such as a Bosch. I love my Bosch mixer because it makes this bread so much easier! This one not only tastes good, it rises more than than white-bread-flour recipe I used to make. It is also soft and freezes well.

I make my bread on Sunday, then make and freeze my sandwiches for the week. But honestly, swapping whole wheat flour for some (or all) of the all-purpose or bread flour (a.k.a. white flour) in your recipes is surprisingly easy. And in most cases, your audience will never know the pancakes , Snickerdoodles , or dinner rolls they&#39;re enjoying are made with whole wheat flour. Whole grain bread is considered a healthier alternative to white bread as its ingredients are less processed. For example, whole wheat bread keeps all three parts (the bran, germ and endosperm) of the wheat kernel intact while white bread filters the bran and germ out.
