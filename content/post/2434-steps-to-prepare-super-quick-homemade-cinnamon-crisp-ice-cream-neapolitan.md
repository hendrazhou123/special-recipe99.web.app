I wanted a cinnamon ice cream to go with apple pie or different cookies and this fits. My Neapolitan Ice Cream Cone charm comes with creamy vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream stuffed inside a crisp waffle cone. I sculpt each piece by hand using polymer clay and then bake the piece in my clay-only oven. Once cooled I give the ice cream portion of the charm a gloss. Bring almost to simmer over medium-high heat.
