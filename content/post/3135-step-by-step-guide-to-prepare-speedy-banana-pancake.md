Buttermilk makes the fluffy interior extra tender, and honey is the only sweetener used in addition to the bananas. They&#39;re not as delicious as when they&#39;re fresh, but they make a nice snack. Larger crêpe-like pancakes: Blend the bananas and eggs in a blender until perfectly smooth. Make slightly larger pancakes and use a very thin spatula to flip.
