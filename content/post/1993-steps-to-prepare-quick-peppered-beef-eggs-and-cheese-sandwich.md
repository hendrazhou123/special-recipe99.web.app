This is my family&#39;s favorite sandwich! We like it served with a nice fresh Caesar salad. Don&#39;t be intimidated by the extra sharp provolone&#39;s smell - it&#39;s really awesome when melted into UGC Reviews Modal. Reviews for: Photos of Beef and Roasted Red Pepper Sandwiches.

Beat until well mixed. i love fancy, expensive, fine cheese as much as the next food snob but i will stand by my opinion that american cheese is the best for breakfast sandwiches (and burgers)! The ratio of ingredients looks spot on. I hate when places put one slice of bacon on my sandwich. Second only to the cold cut heavy Italian sub, Peppers and Eggs is about as Italian-American as you can get, sandwich-wise. This recipe, adapted from Defonte&#39;s in Brooklyn for The Big New York Sandwich Book, is a spot-on home adaptation of the deli classic.
