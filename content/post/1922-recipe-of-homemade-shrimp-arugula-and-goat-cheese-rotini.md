It&#39;s a light and creamy goat cheese coated pasta with shrimp, saut√©ed tomatoes and some broccoli that gets thrown into the food processor so its like a broccoli pesto. That Grey&#39;s was incredible and I could not go to sleep afterwards. Shrimp and Goat cheese sounds good too. Toss the arugula, walnuts, and cranberries in a large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat.

##### Instructions to make Shrimp, arugula and goat cheese rotini:

1. Add the pasta to a pot of boiling salted water.
1. Add a pinch of course salt to the garlic and crush it until it&#39;s paste, using the flat of your knife against a cutting board. Put the garlic in a large mixing bowl along with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and several grinds of freshly cracked black pepper. Add the lemon juice and rind.
1. Add a large splash of extra virgin olive oil to a medium pan. Press down with your palm on the unpeeled garlic cloves to crush them slightly, then add them to the pan along with the rosemary sprig. Let the oil infuse for 3 or 4 minutes, then fish out and discard the garlic and rosemary.

Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper. Arrange the beets around the salad. Sprinkle with the avocado and goat cheese, and serve. We liked the spiciness of arugula with the tomato and goat cheese, but any other greens. Sprinkle evenly with cheese and pepper.
