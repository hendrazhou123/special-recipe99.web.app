After making it a few times, I realized that this pancake recipe is great with all kinds of versions of flour. A while back, when we were grinding our own wheat (yes, that was quite a while back), I used half whole wheat flour, all whole wheat flour, hard white wheat, soft white wheat; basically, I used whatever I have on hand in the freezer. Mix dry ingredients into the liquids until flour is moistened. I&#39;ve tried many whole wheat pancake recipes. Some were good, some not so good but I never had one make me say, Wow!
