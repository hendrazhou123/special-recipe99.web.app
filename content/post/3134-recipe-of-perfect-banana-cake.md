Banana Cake Recipes We love baking with bananas, and it&#39;s no surprise why: They taste amazing in just about everything! Here are the cakes we go bananas for, including a banana tres leches cake and a banana, marshmallow and peanut butter poke cake that&#39;s completely divine. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl occasionally. For a banana CAKE however I think a more tender soft texture is in order. To accomplish this I substituted cake flour in place of all-purpose flour.
