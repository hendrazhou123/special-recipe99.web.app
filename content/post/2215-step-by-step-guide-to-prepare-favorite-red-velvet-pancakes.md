recipeinstructions:
- "I used my griddle iron with this recipe, you don&#39;t want it to be too hot or your pancake will brown slightly. I recommend seeing it a little under 350 not over 360."
- "Grease your griddle or pan lightly with cooking oil, olive oil, or if you have some spray on like PAM."
- "In a medium or large bowl pour in your measured amounts of complete pancake mix and your red velvet mix."
- "Add your water and mix. The mix well be pasty from the red velvet mix. that is ok, that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be."
- "Take your butter and I&#39;m small pieces drop it into the mix."
- "Add one or two splashes of milk. I used 2% milk (personally), mix by hand. I mixed with a simple spoon. there will be small lumps of butter and that is fine. mix until there isn&#39;t many but they will not be of any harm. you can probably mix with your mixer to make your mixture smoother, if not you&#39;ll be fine."
- "Once griddle is hot, pour on your mixture until you&#39;ve reached your desired size."
- "Allow them to cook just as you would any pancakes. Until it bubbles on the top and flip. I recommend 2-3 minutes each side but keep an eye on them as it may not take as long. you don&#39;t want them to cook too long."
- "Once they are done I like to drizzle then with an homemade icing made from cream cheese."
- "I&#39;m not sure if this recipe works with any other pancake and red velvet mixes. I wanted red velvet pancakes and gave this a try and they came out PERFECT for me and my boys. A great alternative to making them completely from scratch. I truly hope you guys enjoy."
