I absolutely love peanut butter and peanut butter pie is one of my favorites. But I&#39;m a Registered Dietitian, so I knew just how high my original recipe was in fat and calories.

There are a lot of similar peanut butter pie recipes, but the differences in this one pay off in a big way - a homemade rather than purchased cookie crust and real, fresh whipped cream rather than &#34;frozen whipped topping.&#34; All are easy to make but the couple of extra steps it takes to use these higher quality ingredients are worth it. Peanut butter is stirred into whipped cream cheese and confectioners &#39; sugar. Then yummy whipped topping is folded in, and this creamy filling is spooned into a prepared graham cracker crust, and sprinkled with chopped peanuts. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. beat in sugar and peanut butter. Fold in whipped topping; spoon into the crust.
