Use your own creativity in plating. You can place the sauces either directly on the cake or on the surface of the serving plate. All three layers (the cake, middle layer with heavy cream and semisweet chocolate and top layer with white chocolate and heavy cream ) are really simple to If this Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake looked decadent, trust me, the taste is completely in sync with the look - fabulous. The only thing left now is. I served this layered chocolate mousse cake with fresh strawberries but I image it would be good with whipped cream, ice cream, or other fresh berries.
