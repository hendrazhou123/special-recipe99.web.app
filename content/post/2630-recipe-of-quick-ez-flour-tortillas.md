First, mix together the dry ingredients in a large bowl - flour, baking powder and water. While I learned to make flour tortillas using El Rosal (and they were incredible), I tested out the exact same recipe and technique using American all-purpose flour. So while El Rosal flour makes absolutely delicious tortillas and is the most authentic route to go, you can still get the same results using any other.

A flour tortilla forms the crust of this pizza topped with chicken, green bell pepper, and onion that&#39;s a quick and easy dinner for one. Even though I wish my family was into corn tortillas, they&#39;re just not, so flour it is. If I can, I&#39;ll buy the carb conscious or whole-wheat flour tortillas, but this time around, I used regular ol&#39; soft taco-sized tortillas. When it comes to perfect enchilada, you never ever want to use pre-shredded cheese. Substitute flour tortillas for corn tortillas.
