This is a wonderful traditional Red Velvet Cake recipe and the frosting puts it over the top. Having read through the comments I think this recipe is problematic because people have made modifications that. Red velvet cake is a classic American dessert, but it&#39;s becoming more and more popular outside of the US, and for a good reason - it&#39;s so festive Although cake flour is usually used for classic red velvet recipes to make it light, I wanted to stick to all-purpose flour in my recipe, so that everyone can make it. Non ho resistito e ho voluto cimentarmi,di base ho fatto una Red Velvet cake perché mi è stata espressamente chiesta dal festeggiato.
