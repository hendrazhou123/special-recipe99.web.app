Whenever I&#39;ve got brown bananas sitting on my counter my first instinct is to make banana bread. These no yeast banana bread cinnamon rolls were the perfect way to incorporate some ripe fruit. I had so many brown bananas all at once that I made a few new recipes recently. These banana cinnamon rolls are made with a leaner dough, giving you a little freedom to eat a couple and still manage to wear that bikini. (well, that&#39;s what I tell myself). Combine the milk, sugar and yeast in a medium size bowl and stir to combine.
