I wanted the ham salad mixture as a filling for a raw stuffed tomato salad rather than as a sandwich filling, so I cut back on the mayonnaise. Layer the veggies you prefer along with little coriander leaves. Ham and eggs may be a breakfast classic, but they&#39;re even better for lunch: try sliced or quartered hard-boiled eggs layered with a salty black forest ham and a bit of mayo on a hearty white bread. This recipe first ran with the Saveur.com story Perfect Pairs: Two-Ingredient Sandwiches Â». Instead of ham and swiss, try ham, havarti and hard-boiled egg slices.
