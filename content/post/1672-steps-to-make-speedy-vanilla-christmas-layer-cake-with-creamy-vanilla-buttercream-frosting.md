I promise it&#39;s the creamiest batter you&#39;ll ever work with. A real buttercream frosting takes little time to make, can be tinted with food coloring (use paste or gel, not liquid food color), and will hold up to one week if tightly covered and refrigerated. Use a real vanilla; imitations are not recommended. If you can find a vanilla bean paste it&#39;s well worth the investment.

The Vanilla Buttercream Frosting makes it special. When cake layers are completely cool, transfer to cake plate and frost with vanilla buttercream. (I always flip the bottom layer of the cake so that the domed side is facing down and touching the plate. That way, the surface that you&#39;re icing is flat and will minimize any separating between the two layers. This vanilla cake recipe is made in one bowl, and is super moist! One batch makes three, eight-inch cake layers, and is frosted with vanilla buttercream.
