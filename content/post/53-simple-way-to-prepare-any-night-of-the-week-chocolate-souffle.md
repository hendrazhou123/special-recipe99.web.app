- "Whisk the eggs and get to a ribbon stage for the whites and add the sugar in 3 or 4 additions. Keep whisking until it turns in to a foamy mixture. Don’t wanna dry it out, just have semi-stiff peaks."
- "Add half of the egg white mixture to the chocolate mixture. Use a spatula to vigorously stir it in. This will help us in incorporating the rest of the egg whites without deflating the mixture too much."
- "Now add the rest of the egg whites and fold them in."
- "Transfer the batter to a ramekin and bring it up to the lip. Clean up any drippage. (Do not tap). Place them on a baking sheet over some parchment paper."
- "Pop them in to a 375 degree oven for 12 minutes or till they have risen around 1/2 inch. Dust over some coca powder (or powdered sugar) as garnish and serve. Remember don’t have them sitting around as they start deflating the moment they come out of the oven."
