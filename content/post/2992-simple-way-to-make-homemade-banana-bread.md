Banana bread is a great way to use up extra bananas (or those ones that go brown). Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. There are several possible explanations behind this. You may have added too much or too little baking soda, or maybe your baking soda has already gone bad. Baking is an exact science, so little mishaps like this could be detrimental to your bread!
