- "Once the puffs have finished baking, you can open the oven door. They won&#39;t deflate so don&#39;t worry."
- "Let the the puffs cool and then slice in half horizontally.  Fill with whipping cream, custard cream and slices of strawberries. Sprinkle powdered sugar on top with a tea strainer."

Should I boil the other veggies first before mixing it with masala. And also at what point do I need to add the veggies to the masala? egg-free, dairy-free, but not coconut-free! When I got the idea of making cream puffs into my head, I thought why not make them vegan? Butter is a key element in baking, especially in pastries like these, as it creates the flakey layers between dough.

Remove from the heat and add flour all at once. Egg tart made with Chinese puff pastry is one of the best Chinese desserts among the dim sum spread in Base on this reason, palm oil, olive oil and other vegetable oil may not be a good choice.
