It didn&#39;t hold its shape for long on serving plate but the taste was perfect. The texture is silky smooth just like soya bean curd pudding (tou hua豆花), so yummy! I&#39;d say that this is a healthy dessert as it is gluten free, eggless and very easy to make. In a pot, heat the soy milk over low heat, and stir in the sugar until dissolved.
