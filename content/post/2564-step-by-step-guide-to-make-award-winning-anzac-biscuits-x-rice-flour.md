If using almond meal they are a bit crumblier while still hot, so don&#39;t touch them until they&#39;re. I created this recipe gluten-free flour, but oats are a grey area in NZ so they aren&#39;t gluten-free with oats (click here to get informed). If you know it&#39;s safe for you to eat oats, go ahead. If you can&#39;t or you&#39;re unsure, try using gluten-free cornflakes, rice flakes, or quinoa flakes. Still golden, still chewy and delicious, still the best biscuits ever.
