- " Yolk batter"
- "80 gr butter"
- "120 gr cake flour"
- "120 ml condense milk"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp vanilla essence"
- "1/2 tbs instant coffee powder"
- "8 egg yolks"
- " White egg batter"
- "6 egg white"
- "6 tbs granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven at 160Â°C. I used smaller oven, so I preheat my oven around 130Â°C."
- "Prepare your mold (18cm), lay it with parchment paper would be so helpful to make the cake easier to take out after coming out from the oven. Wrap the outer mold with 3 layers of heavy duty aluminium foil, and make sure to wrap it tight, so that later the water vapor would not causing a wet base on the cake while in baking process. To prevent burnt on the top, you could use a sheet of aluminium foil, put on the top of it. Let it hang freely on the top of it, no need to wrap it."
- "Combine all dry ingredients such as flour, salt, vanilla essence, and coffee powder. Stir using balloon whisk and set aside. (If your coffee granules a bit bigger, you need to dissolve it first by using 2 tbs of hot water to make it into a paste, and add it along with the yolk batter later on)."
- "Melt your butter inside a pan with medium low heat until small bubbles appear. Add your dry ingredients mixture, whisk with balloon whisk, add condense milk, take it off from your stove, and stir immediately."
- "Add egg yolks one at a time, whisk until all combine. Set aside."
- "Into another bowl, whisk egg white and sugar until light and fluffy or soft peak. It takes around 2-3 minutes with medium high speed. Set aside."
- "Take some part of the whisked egg white into the yolk batter, fold gently until all combined."
- "Transfer the yolk batter into the egg white batter, fold gently until all combine and mixed well."
- "Pour the mixed batter into the mold, and bake around 90 minutes for the picture above using water bath method."
- "Let your cake rest about 10 minutes, and take it out from the mold and let it completely cool on a cooling wire before cutting it."
- "Tips for Baking: when your batter go into your oven, lower your heat to 150Â°C after first 15 minutes lower it again to 130Â°C-135Â°C and continue with that level for the next hour. After your cake done, don&#39;t immediately take it out from the oven, let it rest until cool inside your oven with the oven&#39;s door wide open about 10 minutes at least. Then unmold it."
- "Tips: it&#39;s best to use a mold with no connections each side. If you used the one with no connections you won t need to wrap the bottom of your mold with aluminium foil, and it will not wet the bottom of your cake"
- "Enjooyy!!! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜"
- "Baking process using a 21x10 cm loaf pan (half recipe)"
- "The result after baking."

I&#39;m such a brutally scary stalker fan of coffee flavour, particularly Vietnamese style coffee - dark roast coffee dripping on top of a sweet and saucy thick pile of sweetened condensed milk, set over ice so it gets all melty, milky. This sweetened condensed milk pound cake is moist, dense and lightly sweet. It&#39;s perfect served for breakfast (along with some delicious Millstone Coffee of course!) - and it&#39;s also wonderful served for dessert with fruit or any other kind of sweet topping. What is your favorite everyday cake? It brings me joy enjoying a slice of pound cake with a cup of a hot tea or hot coffee.
