- "Add almond flour. Mix it until combined while crushing lumps."
- "Add all the flour. Mix it while cutting it, scooping sometimes. Mix it until the large lumps form. It&#39;s okay the dough seems to be powdery at this stage."
- "Take the dough out from the bowl. Press lightly to flatten, cut in half and stack one on top of the other."
- "Repeat it until powderiness disappears or smooth. (about 12times) When it becomes smooth, the dough won&#39;t stick to your hand."

- "Cut it with cookie cutters and press cookie stamp onto it. Take off each cookie gently not to lose it&#39;s shape and put them on a tray. It&#39;s easy to take off if you touch it through plastic wrap."
- "Re-roll the dough scraps and cut again. Place the cookies in the freezer for 1 hour to keep the trace of the stamp."
- "Preheat an oven to 190℃ / 374 F. Take the cookies out from the freezer and put them on a baking tray. Bake it at 170℃ / 338 F for 15-17 mins. (cookie size 4.5 cm / 1.8 inch→Bake for 15mins, cookie size 6 cm / 2.4 inch→Bake for 16-17mins)"
- "Cool them down well. Freshly baked cookies are soft but become crisp when cooled. If you put them in a closed container, they will keep crispy texture for about 3 days."
