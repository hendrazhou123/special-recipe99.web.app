Hey everyone, it's Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, banana bread. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Banana Bread is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They are fine and they look wonderful. Banana Bread is something that I've loved my whole life.

I&#39;m not a big fan of banana bread, but we had three or four bananas wasting away in the pantry so I decided to give this bread a shot. Cream the sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose, only when those last three bananas are almost black.


To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook banana bread using 8 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Banana Bread:

1. Make ready 1/2 cup butter
1. Get 1 cup sugar
1. Prepare 2 eggs, beaten
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp vanilla
1. Prepare 3-4 bananas, mashed
1. Prepare 1 1/2 cup flour
1. Get 1 tsp baking soda
1. Get 1/2 tsp salt


In another bowl, combine the eggs, bananas, oil, buttermilk and vanilla; add to flour mixture, stirring just until combined. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Banana bread is a great way to use up extra bananas (or those ones that go brown). Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.

There are several possible explanations behind this. You may have added too much or too little baking soda, or maybe your baking soda has already gone bad. Baking is an exact science, so little mishaps like this could be detrimental to your bread! I firmly believe that banana bread is something you should be able to make anytime and anywhere, with a mixer or with a fork, in a loaf pan or in a muffin tin — whenever you have a few bananas going soft and freckly. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.
