recipeingredient:
- " Cookie Bars "
- "2 3/4 cups all purpose flour"
- "1 1/2 tsp. baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened to room temperature"
- "1 1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg  1 large egg yolk at room temperature"
- "2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- " Frosting "
- "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature"
- "1 3/4 cup confectioners sugar"
- "2 tbsp. cream or milk"
- "1/2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "Pinch salt"
- " Sprinkles optional for decoration"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9x13&#34; baking pan with parchment paper, leaving enough of an overhang to easily luft out the finished bars. Set it aside."
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt until thoroughly combined. Set it aside."
- "Using either a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or a hand mixer, beat the butter on med-high speed until creamy, 1-2 minutes. Then beat in the sugar for 1 minute, until fluffy. Beat in the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract until combined. Scrape down the sides as needed."
- "On low speed, add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. The dough will be thick and sticky."
- "Press the dough evenly into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to lightly brown. The center will still look very soft."
- "Place the baking pan on a wire rack and let it cool completely. Once cool, lift out with the parchment paper and frost."
- "For the frosting, in a medium bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, beat the butter until creamy, 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the frosting ingredients and mix until combined. You can add more cream if you&#39;d like a thinner frosting. Frost the cookie bars before slicing them. You can also decorate with sprinkles after frosting if you&#39;d like to. Use a large, sharp knife to slice them."
- "Store these in an airtight container for 3 or so days. Don&#39;t stack them, as the frosting will not harden and set much."
