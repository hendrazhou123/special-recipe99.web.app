It really is one of those things that&#39;s. Although commonly associated with Thai cuisine, peanut sauce actually originated in Indonesia (). What Americans know as peanut sauce is more commonly referred to as satay sauce (or bumbu kacang) in Indonesia, because it&#39;s most often served with the popular Indonesian dish, satay (skewered, grilled meats). Our inspired version is not authentic and closer to a Thai. Creamy peanut butter moves beyond snacks and sandwiches and into a beautifully balanced tart, sweet, and savory sauce.
