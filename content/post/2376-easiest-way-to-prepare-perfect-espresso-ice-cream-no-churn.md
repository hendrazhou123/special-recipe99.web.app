I have fallen hard for this no-churn method for making ice cream. No churn means no ice cream maker, and living in a small apartment with a kitchen the size of a bathroom, I&#39;ve never sprung on an ice cream maker in fear of where I&#39;d store it. No-churn ice cream means there&#39;s no need for an ice cream machine to make creamy ice cream that&#39;s creamy, homemade vanilla ice cream that&#39;s ready to lick in just a few hours. Most homemade ice creams start with an egg custard base that is cooked and tended to with the same care as your first.
