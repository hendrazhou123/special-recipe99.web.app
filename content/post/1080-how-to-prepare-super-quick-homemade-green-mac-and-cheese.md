While it didn&#39;t seem very spicy to me, it came out delightfully creamy and gooey with just a hint of a kick. This mac and cheese is not only super creamy and cheesy, it&#39;s packed with nutritious veggies like spinach, broccoli and sweet peas which only add to the heavenly nature of this traditional, kid friendly recipe.

We figured out a way to eat your greens while eating macaroni and cheese. MUNCHIES Culinary Director, Farideh Sadeghin, shows us how to make this. Leeks, broccolini and spinach add color and nutrition to this cheesy pasta, which gets a dose of crunch from a toasted almond topping. This mac and cheese recipe from Jamie Oliver&#39;s latest cookbook is full of greenery—like spinach, leek, and broccolini. &#34;Swap spinach out for any kind of exciting fresh or frozen greens, discarding any tough stalks. I also sometimes add breadcrumbs to the top for bonus crunch.
