- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "20 grams Honey"
- "1 Large egg"
- "40 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"

recipeinstructions:
- "Measure the ◎ ingredients in a plastic bag, hold the bag closed with your hand so that there&#39;s some air left inside, and shake. Break up any flour lumps. Shake the bag really well."

- "Preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 180℃, and baking time to 35 minutes. Line a pound cake pan with a liner or parchment paper."
- "Put the ★ ingredients into the bowl, and mix well with a whisk. Mix until the egg and oil are incorporated thoroughly. You don&#39;t need to whip the mixture."
- "Add half of the flour from Step 1, and mix with the whisk. When it&#39;s still a little floury, add the rest of the flour, and mix well."
- "Add the milk at the end, and mix. Change to a spatula, pour the batter into the cake pan, and even out the surface. Drop the cake pan from a little height twice to remove any trapped air."
- "Bake it in the oven. After 10 minutes, make a slit lengthwise on top of the cake, close the oven door immediately, and keep baking."
- "Insert a toothpick into the cake, and if it comes out clean, it&#39;s done. Take it out of the oven, and gently drop the cake pan on a work surface once to remove air."
- "Place the cake pan on a cooling rack, and wrap the cake in the pan with cling film . When the cake pan is cool enough to touch, remove the cake from the pan, wrap with cling film, and let it cool at room temperature."
- "In Step 9, cut the cling film big enough to wrap the cake in the pan. Because the cake pan is hot, the cling film will stick to the pan. And this will keep the cake moist."
- "After cooling the cake at room temperature, let it sit in the fridge for a whole day if you can. By doing so, it will make the cake more moist and tasty. Bring the cake to room temperature before eating."
- "I bought the pound cake pan (metal) and liner from a 100 yen shop."
