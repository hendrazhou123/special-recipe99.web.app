Cream Puffs are a classic French dessert filled with sweet cream and dusted with powdered sugar. Creamy and luscious vanilla pastry cream encased with a light and golden dough…it&#39;s perfect. A true, classic cream puff is choux pastry filled with straight-up whipped cream, but I like making a pastry cream with whipped cream folded in to lighten it, kind of a hybrid between the two. Until a few months ago, cream puffs didn&#39;t interest me much. That is, until I tasted THESE cream puffs.
