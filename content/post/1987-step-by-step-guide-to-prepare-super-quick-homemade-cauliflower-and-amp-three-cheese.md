recipeingredient:
- "1 large cauliflower"
- "1 leek"
- "1/4 cup (50 g) butter"
- "1/2 cup (50 g) flour"
- "1 pint (550 ml) milk"
- "2 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
- "1 large teaspoon chopped parsley"
- "2 cloves chopped garlic"
- "75 g grated Gruyre"
- "75 g Camembert"
- "75 g grated smoked cheddar"
- " Black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil cauliflower, add salt to the water."
- "Wash and cut leek into round slices, submerge in a bowl of cold water. Shake to remove any grit between the layers. Allow to sit in the water for a few minutes then scoop into a colander."
- "Melt the butter in a pan. Add the flour and stir well until it is combined. Keep stirring this mix for 1 minute on a medium heat to cook the starch, then remove from the heat."
- "Add 3 Tablespoons of the milk. Combine using the spoon, stirring until it is combined. Then add 1/3 of the milk, again, stir until it is combined. Keep stirring the mixture, it will take a couple of minutes and you will get lumps. The lumps will go, so long as you stir. Use your spoon to make sure none of the flour is stuck in the sides of the pan. At this stage, return the pan to a medium heat, and add the remaining milk."
- "Whisk in the mustard, parsley and garlic. Continue to stir until the sauce becomes thick and holds to the whisk. It should be a ‘coating’ consistency. Be patient, it will seem like nothing is happening for a while, then suddenly, hey presto! The sauce immediately thickens."
- "Add the Gruyère and Camembert, stir in well until combined."
- "In a baking dish place the cauliflower and leek, add the cheese sauce over the top."
- "Cook for 20mins at 200C"
- "Remove from oven and add smoked cheddar over top, season with pepper then put back in the oven to cook until the smoked cheddar has browned."
