I actually prefer Rabokki more than Tteokbokki as there&#39;s more interesting and delicious additional ingredients. Dried anchovies, dried kelp, eggs, fish cakes, green onion, hot pepper flakes, hot pepper paste, rice cake, sugar, water. You know those delicious chewy, sticky rice cakes swimming in sweet, spicy red sauce you find in Korean restaurants? Spicy gochujang really makes this dish.
