Ritz Meringue Cake &amp; whipped chocolate cream. This delicious vanilla cake is perfect for a baby shower. A vanilla cake filled with vanilla cream, raspberry jam and banana, then covered in a white chocolate frosting and pink marzipan. This Chocolate Layer Cake with Creme turns out so fluffy and nice. I tried her chocolate frosting and I think I over-whipped and made it grainy (still tasty, but despite my best efforts to salvage it, the final product just wasn&#39;t pretty and neither was this situation).
