recipeingredient:
- " Oreo Crust"
- "20 oreo cookies"
- "5 tbsp. unsalted butter melted"
- " Cheesecake Filling"
- "3 (8 oz.) each brick style cream cheese at room temp"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 cup sour cream or plain yogurt at room temperature"
- "3 large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 tbsp. vanilla extract"
- "18 oreos"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make sure your oven rack is in the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9&#34; springform pan and wrap aluminum foil tightly around the outside walls of the springform pan. Set it aside."
- "First, make the crust. In a food processor, pulse the Oreos into fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs out into a large bowl. Stir the butter and the cookie crumbs together until combined. Then press them tightly into the bottom of the springform pan. I use the bottom of a metal measuring cup to really tightly pack the crumbs down."
- "Pre-bake the crust for 9 minutes, then remove it from the oven and set it aside as you prepare the cheesecake. While that&#39;s pre-baking, place the other 18 Oreos in the food processor and pulse just a couple of times, until coarsely crumbled."
- "Using a hand held or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sugar together on medium speed until it&#39;s smooth and creamy. Then add the sour cream (or yogurt) and vanilla. Switch to low speed and add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just combined. Gently fold in about 3/4 of the crumbled oreos. Cover the remaining Oreos and set them aside for now."
- "Pour the filling into the crust. Place the springform pan into a larger roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan about halfway up with hot water. Place this into the oven for 45-60 minuted, or until the center is nearly set. There should still be a 2 to 3 inch wobbly spot in the center, which will set as it cools."
- "Once the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and open the oven door a crack. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour, then take it out, run a butter knife gently around the edges of the cheesecake to help loosen it from the springform pan and place it, still in the pan, on a wire rack and allow it to cool completely."
- "Once it&#39;s cooled to room temperature, cover it and place it in the fridge for at least 4 hours. When you&#39;re ready to serve, remove the rim of the pan and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 of the crumbled Oreos over the top. Cut into slices with a large, sharp knife and serve. Store any remaining cheesecake covered in the fridge for up to 4 days."
