We love sesame bagels, but seed loss was putting us at risk for sprouting a sesame plantation right on the dining room rug. The next day, you would hand-grind the sweet rice along with water, ONE SPOONFUL AT A TIME by feeding it through the small hole on top of the grinder. Yep. pork suet was used in traditional sweet black sesame balls. With cold temperatures this time of year and no indoor heating, kneading solid fat. This recipe uses bread flour and boils the bagels before they head into the oven to achieve that fantastic texture.
