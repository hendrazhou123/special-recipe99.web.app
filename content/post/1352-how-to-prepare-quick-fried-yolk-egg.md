A fried egg, is a cooked dish made from one or more eggs which are removed from their shells and placed into a frying pan, and fried with minimal accompaniment. If you&#39;re like us and prefer a runny yolk but cooked whites, this is the recipe for you. I have a maxim for eggs: When you cook eggs, walk on eggs. If you want to make an over-easy egg, use a thin spatula and slide it directly under the yolk.
