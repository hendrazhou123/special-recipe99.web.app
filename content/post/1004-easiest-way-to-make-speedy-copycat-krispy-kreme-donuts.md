recipeingredient:
- " Donut Dry Ingredients"
- "6 1/4 cup Allpurpose Flour"
- "2 1/2 Tb Honey"
- "2 1/4 tsp Active Dry Yeast"
- "1/2 cup Softened Salted Butter"
- "2 cup Lukewarm Milk"
- "2 1/2 Tb Honey"
- "3 Large Eggs"
- "2 Tb Vegetable Oil"
- "1 Tb Vanilla Extract"
- " Glaze"
- "4 cup Icing Sugar"
- "1 3/4 tsp Vanilla Extract"
- "1/2 cup Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all dough ingredients together in a large bowl. This recipe can be mixed with a standing mixer or by hand."
- "Mix the dough ingredients together, knead into a smooth ball (approx. 10 minutes if by hand). If dough is too sticky, you can add small amounts of flour, but be sure not to over flour as your dough can become too tough."
- "Once the dough is smooth and supple, gather the dough into a ball, coat it lightly with flour and place in a bowl covered with a damp towel. Place it in a warm area to rise until doubled in size."
- "Once doubled, place the dough in the refrigerator over night to chill."
- "Mix the glaze ingredients together in a medium bowl and cover the bowl."
- "Once the dough is chilled, roll it out on a floured surface until it is 1/3 inch thick. Use a donut cutter to cut the donut shapes out. I re-rolled the remaining dough once to get more donuts, but do not suggest rolling twice as the dough will become too tough."
- "Place each donut on it&#39;s own parchment square to proof until puffed, approximately 10-20 minutes."
- "Fill a large pot with oil approximately 1.5-2 inches deep and heat the oil to 325 F."
- "Fry the donuts in batches, turning them only once until they are lightly golden brown, approximately 1.5-2 minutes per side."
- "Let them cool on a wire rack and then cover with glaze. Let the glaze set at room temperature."

I&#39;m partial to chocolate cake myself. It contains a mix of white and brown rice flour plus sweet white sorghum and it makes these Gluten Free Doughnuts (Krispy Kreme Copycat) awesome! These doughnuts taste just like Krispy Kreme&#39;s! They&#39;re soft and fluffy and every bite will melt in your mouth. If you are up here in the middle of nowhere in Northern Michigan where you can&#39;t buy a Krispy Kreme to save your soul, these ARE a fantastic substitute, according to my husband, an avid Krispy Kreme fan!
