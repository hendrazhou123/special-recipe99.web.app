And the best part is that they freeze and reheat beautifully (I just throw the frozen biscuits in the toaster oven on the bake setting). So make a big batch, freeze a bunch in a gallon zip lock freezer bag, and then the next time you want to add a biscuit to your breakfast, lunch or dinner they are ready to go. When you flour your board to roll out biscuits use plain all-purpose flour (preferably soft wheat) for dusting since you don&#39;t want to add anymore flour that has leavening in it. In a medium bowl, combine flours, baking powder, sugar, and salt; mix well.

Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk just until moistened. The simple goodness of old fashioned on today&#39;s busy timeline? Plus, they&#39;re made with whole wheat flour and are refined sugar free. Using room-temperature butter and working it into the flour until the mixture is an even, breadcrumb-like consistency will yield tender biscuits with an even, light crumb.
