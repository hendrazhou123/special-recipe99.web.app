Hey everyone, it's me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, banana bread. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

I&#39;m not a big fan of banana bread, but we had three or four bananas wasting away in the pantry so I decided to give this bread a shot. Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose, only when those last three bananas are almost black. This scrumptious banana-walnut loaf, spiked with dark chocolate chips, is so good you&#39;ll want to make it well before the bananas get to that condition.

Banana bread is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. Banana bread is something which I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have banana bread using 8 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

In another bowl, combine the eggs, bananas, oil, buttermilk and vanilla; add to flour mixture, stirring just until combined. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.

There are several possible explanations behind this. You may have added too much or too little baking soda, or maybe your baking soda has already gone bad. Baking is an exact science, so little mishaps like this could be detrimental to your bread! I firmly believe that banana bread is something you should be able to make anytime and anywhere, with a mixer or with a fork, in a loaf pan or in a muffin tin â€” whenever you have a few bananas going soft and freckly. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
