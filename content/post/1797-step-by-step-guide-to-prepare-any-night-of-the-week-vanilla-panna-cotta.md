- "Prepare your serving glasses or cups. You can serve your finished panna cotta in a cup (ex: wine glass), or you can flip it onto a plate after it has set.

- "Pour the finished mixture evenly into your cups or glasses. Depending on how large or small you want your portions to be, you can divide this into 4 to 6 servings. I personally do 6 smaller servings, but people usually do a full 1/2 cup serving per person. Obviously, the smaller servings will set up faster"
- "Place your serving cups into the refrigerator and let them set for at least 3 hours."
- "Once your panna cotta has a kind of &#34;uniform jiggle&#34; it is done.  At this point, you can serve it as is, or you can top it with whatever you like! Some examples are: chocolate sauce, caramel, fresh berries, fruit sauce, etc. The possibilities are, literally, endless!"
