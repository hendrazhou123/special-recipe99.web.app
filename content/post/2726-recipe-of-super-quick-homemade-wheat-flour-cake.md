Any lighter-colored baked goods (sugar cookies, white sandwich bread, lemon muffins, etc.) will be slightly darker when baked.

Its grains are visibly finer than bread flour, and it is much whiter in color. Its fine, soft texture makes it preferable for tender cakes and pastries. Cake flour, bread flour, pastry flour, and all-purpose flour (which are all made from wheat) vary primarily by the type of wheat they&#39;re made from and their protein content, which is perhaps the most interesting and certainly the most significant difference between them, especially when it comes to baking. This Wheat cake recipe is an easy and delicious recipe of eggless cake made with whole wheat flour (atta), sweetened condensed milk and butter. I had got a few requests for an eggless sponge cake made without curd or apple sauce or aquafaba or any puree.
