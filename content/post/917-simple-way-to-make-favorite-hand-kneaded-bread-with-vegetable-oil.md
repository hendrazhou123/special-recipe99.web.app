recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tsp Dry yeast"
- "150 ml Milk"
- "40 ml Heavy cream"
- "15 grams Canola oil or vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the milk and heavy cream until warm to the touch. Put the bread flour in a bowl. Add salt, yeast and sugar (keeping the salt away from the other two). Pour the ★ milk on the yeast."
- "Mix with a rubber spatula and transfer the mixture on to a work surface."
- "Knead with the lower part of your palm (near your wrist), rubbing the dough from  closest to you and stretch out. It will be sticky for a while, but it will clump up eventually. (The picture doesn&#39;t look good but...)"
- "When it clumps, pour the canola oil on the dough and rub with both of your hands. The dough will absorb the oil after a while."
- "When the dough has absorbed the oil, repeat the process of rubbing the dough a few times. Use your wrist, pound the dough onto the work space and then fold it into half, pound the dough again and fold it into half. Repeat the pounding and folding process a few times. When the surface of the dough becomes smooth, roll the dough into a ball while pulling and tucking the surface in. (Don&#39;t let go of the dough when you are pounding it. Pound the dough like you are stretching it.)"
- "Cover the bowl with the dough using a shower cap. Let it sit for the 1st proofing in a warm place until the dough doubles in size. I recommend keeping it by a window that gets a lot of sun or in a car."
- "When the dough has risen, coat your finger with flour and do the finger check. If you poke a hole in the dough but it closes up soon after you take your finger out, let it sit a little bit more."
- "Gently punch down the dough and divide it into 3 portions using a bench scraper. Tuck the cut ends in and roll into balls. Let it sit for 15 minutes, making sure that it doesn&#39;t dry out."
- "Roll out the dough out and fold into thirds. Seal the joint parts well using your finger. (You can roll the dough any way you like.)"
- "Line the balls of dough in the pan as shown, with one in the center and two on the ends. If you want to give the bread a rounded top, let the dough rise to 1 to 2 cm higher than the mold. If you want the bread to be a square shape on top, let the dough rise to 2 cm lower than the mold."
- "Bake in a 360°F/180°C oven for 30 minutes. Cover with an aluminum foil if it starts to burn."
- "Cheese Bread Shape the dough into balls and make a cross cut using scissors. Top with pizza cheese in the cut and bake."
- "Braided bread with sausages."
- "Brown Sugar Bread When you roll out the dough after the 1st proofing, sprinkle some brown sugar and roll, then let it sit for the 2nd proofing."

You can knead most bread doughs by hand or in a stand mixer (we&#39;ll show each technique in detail below). While hand kneading can be a gratifying process, we recommend using a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment for this task. Not only is it easier—the mixer does all the work—but you&#39;re. This crusty bread gets its complex flavors and chewy interior from a long, slow fermentation--just like you&#39;d get from an artisan bakery. I&#39;ve been baking no-knead bread ever since the original recipe came out in the New York Times several years ago, so trust me when I tell you it is not recommended.
