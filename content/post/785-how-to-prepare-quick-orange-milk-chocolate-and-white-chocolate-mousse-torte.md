White Chocolate Torte - A creamy, decadent white chocolate torte with a gingernut biscuit crumb base, and garnished with fresh raspberries and chocolate chips! As a kid, I would always reach for it more often than milk chocolate. An indulgent dessert you can also make and freeze in advance. Using a peeler, make flakes out of the remaining white chocolate and scatter over the torte, so the chocolate looks spiky, then scatter the Maltesers on top.
