I&#39;ve been meaning to make red velvet whoopie pies for years, so I appreciate you pushing me to do so! Fun fact: Did you know that in western PA, where my in-laws are from, whoopie pies are called gobs?

Try our whoopie pies, large red velvet, cake-like sweet sandwiches with a fluffy white filling and a berry bonus!
