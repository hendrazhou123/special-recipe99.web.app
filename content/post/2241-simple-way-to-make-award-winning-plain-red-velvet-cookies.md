##### The ingredients needed to make Plain red velvet cookies:

1. Make ready 3 and 1/2 cups flour
1. Get 1/4 cup sugar

Imagine the best red velvet cupcake you&#39;ve ever had, re-engineered into the softest, puffiest, chewiest cookie… Make cookies: Scoop a heaping tablespoon of the cookie dough and flatten into a pancake-like circle on the baking sheet. Bring the edges of the dough around the filling and pinch the edges together to seal, adding more dough if necessary to. Unlike many red velvet cookie recipes that call for softened butter, you&#39;ll actually use melted butter (or coconut oil, to keep them dairy-free!) in this recipe. I love using melted butter for two reasons: a it makes your healthy red velvet chocolate chip cookies softer and chewier and b it&#39;s much faster.
