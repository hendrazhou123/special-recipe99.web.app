- "Bake for 12-15, until they don&#39;t wiggle to touch, I went for 15 as they seemed to still be a little wiggles at 12."
- "Let them rest until cool, Longer they sit uncovered and unbagged they will continue to harden to the point of biscotti after a few days exposed."
- "I may try to twice bake them, as traditional biscotti is done. The second bake might dry them out quicker. I may tinker with the amount of water/yogurt as well. These things seem quite awesome once hardened so any way to quicken the hardening process the better."
