<li>Cut it with cookie cutters and press cookie stamp onto it. Take off each cookie gently not to lose it's shape and put them on a tray. It's easy to take off if you touch it through plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Re-roll the dough scraps and cut again. Place the cookies in the freezer for 1 hour to keep the trace of the stamp.</li>
<li>Preheat an oven to 190℃ / 374 F. Take the cookies out from the freezer and put them on a baking tray. Bake it at 170℃ / 338 F for 15-17 mins. (cookie size 4.5 cm / 1.8 inch→Bake for 15mins, cookie size 6 cm / 2.4 inch→Bake for 16-17mins)</li>
<li>Cool them down well. Freshly baked cookies are soft but become crisp when cooled. If you put them in a closed container, they will keep crispy texture for about 3 days.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have also used Tillamook salted butter with equally excellent results. This basic butter cookie recipe is simple to prepare. Vanilla and a touch of orange juice add subtle flavor. If there's anything kids like even more than eating cookies, it's making them. Little ones can help mix the dough, and if you want to try your hand at making cut-out shapes, they can help roll out.</p>
