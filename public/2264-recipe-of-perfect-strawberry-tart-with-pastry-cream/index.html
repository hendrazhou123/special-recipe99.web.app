<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s Drew, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a distinctive dish, ✨strawberry tart with pastry cream✨. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>This French style strawberry tart with a buttery crust, and a creamy, buttery pastry cream filling is the best way to celebrate those gorgeous summer berries! Replace strawberries with any fresh berries or fruits to make a beautiful and delicious fruit tart. There is inactive chilling time in the recipe.</p>
<p>✨Strawberry Tart With Pastry Cream✨ is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It is appreciated by millions every day. ✨Strawberry Tart With Pastry Cream✨ is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook ✨strawberry tart with pastry cream✨ using 19 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-strawberry-tart-with-pastry-cream">The ingredients needed to make ✨Strawberry Tart With Pastry Cream✨:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 400 g Strawberry</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 Cup Sugar</li>
<li>Get  ✨Crust✨</li>
<li>Make ready 150 g Butter</li>
<li>Take 50 g Sugar Powder</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>Prepare 1/8 Tsp Salt</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Egg</li>
<li>Get 50 g Ground Almond</li>
<li>Make ready 230 g All Purpose Flour</li>
<li>Take 1 Egg Yolk for brushing</li>
<li>Prepare  ✨Pastry Cream ✨</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Cup Milk</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
<li>Make ready 6 Egg Yolks</li>
<li>Get 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>Prepare 2 Tbsp Corn Starch</li>
<li>Prepare 20 g Salted Butter</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 Cup Sugar</li>
</ol>
<p>In a French fruit tart, the tart shell is baked ahead of time, then topped with room-temperature or cold fillings: jam, pastry cream, fruit, and the glaze. Unlike an apple pie, in which the fruit is baked together with the crust, every component of a French fruit tart is cooked separately, and assembled just before. This strawberry tart recipe has a buttery crust filled with lemon and orange pastry cream, and is topped with fresh strawberries. Feel free to also season with salt and pepper (or stir in cream cheese for added decadence).</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-strawberry-tart-with-pastry-cream">Instructions to make ✨Strawberry Tart With Pastry Cream✨:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). In a medium bowl, mix strawberries with 1/4 cup of sugar. Cover it with plastic wrap and let the sugar dissolve into the strawberries’ juice. It can take around 40-60 minutes.</li>
<li>To prepare the crust, place the flour, almond flour, salt and sugar in a food processor and mix until just combined. Then add the butter, egg and vanilla extract and process the mix until the pastry just holds together when pinched. Wrap it up and chill until hardened.</li>
<li>To make the pastry cream, add the sugar and half of the milk to a pot. Then, bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat. In a separate small bowl, place corn starch, egg yolks, vanilla extract, heavy whipping cream, and the rest of the milk. Mix it very well. Then, pour the egg mixture into a medium saucepan and cook it over medium heat.</li>
<li>When it starts to boil, whisk cream mixture very quickly for another 30-60 seconds until it becomes thick. Remove it from the heat and then mix in the butter well. Transfer the pastry cream into a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Chill it completely in the fridge. Mix the pastry cream with a whisk before consuming so it regains a smooth texture.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough and fit it into a tart pan. Cut off the excess dough on the sides. Then, lightly prick dough with a fork and chill it for 20 min. Line the tart pan with aluminum foil and fill it with rice to prevent the bottom of the crust from puffing up. Bake the tart crust for 20 minutes. Remove the rice and foil and then use a pastry brush to apply an egg wash onto the pre-baked tart crust.</li>
<li>Bake the tart crust for another 10 minutes. Remove it from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Fill the tart crust with the pastry cream.</li>
<li>Arrange the strawberries in a decorative fashion on top of the cream. Enjoy!😉</li>
</ol>
<p>Grease a skillet with butter over medium heat and pour in the egg. This vegan strawberry tart is the perfect Summery dessert to end a garden party or barbecue with; it goes wonderfully with a glass of champagne or To serve, fill the tart shell with the pastry cream and top with a pile of freshly sliced strawberries. You can also use any other kind of fruit that you like too. A beautifully baked tart base, filled with a velvety pistachio pastry cream and topped with the sweetest and juiciest strawberries. I love all kinds of pastry cream; from the most classic vanilla to lemon, chocolate, orange and so on.</p>
