<p>A few weeks ago I had a conversation with a devout home cook who couldn't understand the I love red wine and always have it in the house for drinking but if you do not and are worried about the leftover wine you can freeze it. This red wine-braised brisket is a one-pot meal that's super easy to make! But you don't have to tell your guests that. I'm back with day two of my self-imposed brisket week! When I set a goal for myself, I sure to stick to it (pats self on back).</p>
