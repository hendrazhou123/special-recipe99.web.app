<p>As I researched strawberry cake recipes, I noticed that a good bit of them still used strawberry Jello. I wanted my strawberry flavor to come from fresh strawberries, not gelatin. Does anyone need an excuse to layer fresh berries with chocolate covered strawberries and mini meringues? This richly layered chocolate and berry cream cake will surely be a Christmas special.</p>
