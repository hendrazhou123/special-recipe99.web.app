<li>Shave (not peel - the skin has lots of nutrients) the burdock roots using the dull edge of a knife and cut the same shape as carrots. To avoid discoloring, in a small bowl, put the cut burdocks into a cold water with 1 tsp white vinegar for 2 minutes. Rinse with cold water couple times. Add to the pot.</li>
<li>Cut cabbages into the similar shape as others. Add to the pot.</li>
<li>Thinly slice onion. Add to the pot.</li>
<li>Peel the edge of snap peas. Add to the pot.</li>
<li>Remove the chicken from the pot and cut into bite shapes. (It’s ok if it’s not cooked at this point. It will be cooked by the end). Return to the pot.</li>
<li>Remove shiitake mushrooms from the pot and slice them and return to the pot.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to high and let it boil. Make sure all the ingredients become clear.</li>
<li>Remove scums from the soup</li>
<li>Add soy sauce, sake, miso and mentsuyu, keep the heat high. If it start boiling,turn the heat to low. We don’t want to have it bubbling hot because it ruins the flavor.</li>
<li>Drop eggs into the soup pot. (If you like half boiled soft egg, it takes 7 minutes).</li>
<li>(If you have mochi). Add mochi 2 minutes before eggs are done. The sauce is done ✅</li>
<li>Cook the noodles. In a large pot, put soba noodle into a boiling water. After it’s cooked, strain and rinse with cold water. (Rinsing with cold water will avoid over cooking and also remove the stickiness). Reserve the hot water and start boil the water again. Keep the cooked noodles in the cold water until you are ready to serve.</li>
<li>Right before you serve, dip the rinsed noodle into the (reserved) hot water to make noodle to be warm. Strain. Place the noodles into the serving bowl then pour the soup over.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the minced scallions at the end enjoy💕(if you like a little kick, add sprinkle of ichimi togarashi as well)</li>
