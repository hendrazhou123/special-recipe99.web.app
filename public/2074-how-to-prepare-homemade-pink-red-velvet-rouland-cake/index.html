<li>In a large bowl, beat eggs with a hand mixer for 5 full minutes - set a timer if you need to! Properly whipped eggs will lighten in color considerably and have the appearance of yellow cake batter.</li>
<li>With the mixer still running, slowly add sugar and oil to the whipped eggs. Next, add buttermilk, vinegar, vanilla extract and food coloring (add food coloring a little at a time until desired color is achieved).</li>
<li>Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Slowly add to the liquid ingredients. Mix until well combined.</li>
<li>Pour batter into prepared pan and tilt pan to distribute batter evenly.</li>
