<h5 id="steps-to-make-chicken-porridge-with-sauté-mushrooms">Steps to make Chicken Porridge with Sauté Mushrooms:</h5>
<ol>

<li>Add mushrooms. Cook until wilted.</li>
<li>Season with oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, and white pepper powder. Adjust to taste. Remove from the heat. Set aside.</li>

<p>They are simply the brown version of the common white cultivated mushroom. I've done a similar recipe with shrimp. Just remember shrimp only needs a few minutes to cook.
