<ol>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare three 9-inch cake pans by buttering lightly and sprinkling with 1 tablespoon sifted cocoa powder, tapping pans to coat and discarding extra cocoa. (You may choose to use just 2 pans, note below.)</li>
<li>Cream butter and sugar together. Add eggs one at a time and beat vigorously until each is incorporated. Mix in vanilla.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, make a paste of the remaining 2 tablespoons cocoa and the food coloring. Blend into butter mixture. (I found 1 teaspoon is adequate)</li>
<li>Sift together remaining dry ingredients. Alternating in 2 batches each, add dry ingredients and buttermilk to the butter mixture. In the last batch of buttermilk, mix in the vinegar before adding to the batter. Mix until blended.</li>
<li>Divide batter among 3 pans and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a rack completely. (Note: I use 2 pans and cook for 30 minutes.)</li>

Remove the second cake from its pan. Place flat side down on top of first layer. Use remaining frosting to cover top and sides of cake.</li>
