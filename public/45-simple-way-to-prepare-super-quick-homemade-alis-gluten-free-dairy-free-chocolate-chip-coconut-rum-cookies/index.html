<p>Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, ali’s gluten-free, dairy-free chocolate chip coconut rum cookies. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>

It is easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic. Ali’s Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Chocolate Chip Coconut Rum Cookies is something which I have loved my whole life.</p>
<p>Gluten-Free Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies. An easy recipe for soft and chewy gluten-free chocolate chip cookies. Baked in just ten minutes with a nice crispy edge.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have ali’s gluten-free, dairy-free chocolate chip coconut rum cookies using 12 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-alis-gluten-free-dairy-free-chocolate-chip-coconut-rum-cookies">The ingredients needed to make Ali’s Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Chocolate Chip Coconut Rum Cookies:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 cup shortening</li>
<li>Make ready 2 large eggs</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp. butter flavoring</li>
<li>Take 1 Tbsp. vanilla flavoring</li>
<li>Get 1/4 cup coconut Rum (Malibu or Parrot Bay)</li>
<li>Make ready 3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>Take 3/4 cup light brown sugar (packed)</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Tbsp. coarse Kosher salt</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp. baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready 2-1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Make ready 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (more or less as desired)</li>
<li>Take 1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes</li>
</ol>
<p>These cookies are both gluten and dairy free, so they are perfect for those on restricted diets. Add flour, coconut and chocolate chips; mix thoroughly. These gluten-free chocolate chip cookies were one I was especially pleased with. These didn't flatten out like I thought they might, but I really enjoyed the thicker texture of In these cookies, I use part gluten-free flour blend and part coconut flour, which I've been experimenting with since it's so healthy.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-alis-gluten-free-dairy-free-chocolate-chip-coconut-rum-cookies">Steps to make Ali’s Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Chocolate Chip Coconut Rum Cookies:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Combine shortening, eggs, flavorings, sugars, rum, and salt. Mix on low to combine, then cream on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes until fully blended and light in color and texture.</li>
<li>In separate bow, combine flour and baking powder. Sift or mix well with whisk.</li>
<li>Turn mixer to lowest speed and fold in flour mixture a little at a time. Alternatively, fold flour mixture into wet batter by hand with large spatula. Fold until combined, but don’t overwork. A little bit of dry flour is ok at this point.</li>
<li>Add chocolate chips and coconut flakes to dough mixture. Fold by hand with large spatula until fully incorporated.</li>
<li>Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour to chill dough.</li>
<li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheet or 1/2 sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Use 1 tablespoon measuring soon to scoop balls of cookie dough. Place on parchment-lined sheet pan, about 2” apart. (1/2 sheet pan makes 12 cookies)</li>
<li>Bake 10-11 minutes until edges start to brown. This will make soft, chewy cookies. For a little firmer bite, cook 1-2 additional minutes until tops start to brown.</li>
<li>Remove from oven and let rest for about 1 minute. Transfer to wire rack to cool.</li>
<li>Let pan cool for a few minutes before starting next batch.</li>
<li>Quick Tip- to speed up process, remove parchment paper and run backside of pan under cool water for 10-15 seconds. Make sure to dry off any excess water. Replace parchment and start next batch.</li>
<li>Option #1 - place a small pinch of coconut flake on top of cookie dough ball before baking to add some extra texture. The flakes will melt in slightly and tips will brown for that toasted coconut flavor.</li>
<li>Option #2 - lightly sprinkle a little extra coarse kosher salt over tops of cookies as soon as removed from oven and resting on pan. Don’t over do it&hellip; just ever so subtle.</li>
<li>Serve warm with glass of favorite milk or coffee. Let cookies cool completely on wire rack and store in air-tight container. The flavor and texture actually gets better the next day!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're vegan or dairy free, use dairy free chocolate chips. Sea salt: Don't you dare forget that sprinkle! Tips for making gluten free chocolate chip cookies. Melt then cool your coconut oil.
