<p>Hello everybody, hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, oil less vegetable sauce. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Oil less vegetable sauce is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic. Oil less vegetable sauce is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>Who says healthy can't be delicious? On BN Cuisine today, we have this vegetable stew or sauce recipe by BukiesKitchenMuse. You can enjoy this with boiled or fried yam, plantain or potatoes.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook oil less vegetable sauce using 9 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-oil-less-vegetable-sauce">The ingredients needed to make Oil less vegetable sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  Unripe plantains</li>
<li>Take  Ugu</li>
<li>Make ready  Onions</li>
<li>Get  Kpanla fish</li>
<li>Prepare  Kpomo</li>
<li>Get cubes Seasoning</li>
<li>Get  Tomatoes</li>
<li>Take  Fresh pepper</li>
<li>Prepare  Crayfish</li>
</ol>
<p>You can enjoy this with Yam, Plantain (Boiled or Fried), Potatoes and so on. I hope you enjoy the video and try it out. Still, vegetable oils are refined and processed, which means they not only lack flavor, but also nutrients, Howard says. Of all vegetable oils, canola oil tends to have the least amount of saturated fats.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-oil-less-vegetable-sauce">Steps to make Oil less vegetable sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Boil the plantains with salt and set aside. I don't like hot food so I do this first.</li>
<li>Blend tomatoes with scotch bonnet peppers and onions and debone your kpanla fish. Wash kpomo too</li>
<li>In a dry pot on fire, pour in your blended mixture and leave to boil till water is almost dry.</li>
<li>Then add your crayfish, deboned kpanla, washed kpomo, and cube seasoning to it and cover to cook for about 20 minutes on medium heat</li>
<li>Add your washed ugu at this point. Once I stir my ugu with the sauce I turn of heat because I still want it crunchy and fresh but you can leave it to cook further</li>
<li>Serve with rice, yam, plantains anything you want to. I always love to add boiled eggs.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has a high smoke point, which means it can be helpful for high-heat cooking. vegetable sauce is very delicious and can be served with rice, beans or yam. I used fresh tomatoes, assorted meat, onions, etc. Olive oil has also been proven to be healthier than groundnut/vegetable oil. At some point, you will start knowing the difference between these choices and how one differs. A super speedy enchilada sauce with a truly authentic taste.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up for this special food oil less vegetable sauce recipe. Thank you very much for reading. I am sure you will make this at home.
