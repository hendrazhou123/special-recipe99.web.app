<h5 id="instructions-to-make-berries-and39-cream-tarts">Instructions to make Berries And' Cream Tarts:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Thaw puff pastry on the counter, then put one sheet on top of the other and press the two together by rolling gently with a rolling pin until about 12x16 inches in size. Do not flour in between. Doubling the sheets will produce higher borders on the tarts. Cut out circles with a 3 inch cookie cutter. Try to cut them out as close as possible, leaving minimal amount of scraps in between.</li>
<li>Remove scraps to a different parchment lined baking sheet. Move each cut out circle about 3/4 inch from each other. Using a 2 inch cookie cutter, press it in the middle of the circle, almost all the way through.</li>
<li>Whisk the eggs together for the egg wash.Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each circle as well as the scraps that were leftover.</li>
<li>Generously sprinkle tops of the cutout circles with granulated sugar.</li>
<li>Bake in preheated to 425°F for 15 minutes or until puffed up and golden in colour.</li>
<li>For the Ganache: Heat 1/2 cup heavy cream until almost boiling. Pour over 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. Let sit for 2-3 minutes. Stir until smooth.</li>
<li>Line a cup with a sandwich size ziplock bag and pour the ganache in.</li>
<li>For the cream: Combine 2 cups heavy cream, 2/3 cup sugar &amp; 1 Tbsp vanilla in a bowl of an electric mixer.</li>
<li>Whip on high until stiff. Fill a pastry bag or a gallon sized ziplock bag fitted with a large star tip with the cream. Refrigerate until ready to use. Try to use within 15 minutes of making it.</li>
<li>Line a large glass or a vase with the pastry bag fitted with a star tip (or a ziplock bag). Set aside.</li>
<li>As soon as the pastries are baked and out of the oven, with your fingers or with a smaller cookie cutter, press in the middle to bring it down, leaving the sides as the borders to our pastries. Let completely cool.</li>
<li>Snip off the end of the ziplock bag with the chocolate ganache and generously drizzle inside of the tarts, leaving about 1/4 of the ganache to drizzle later on top as decoration</li>
<li>Fill the pastry bag with the reserved cream and then use it to fill the middle with cream as well.</li>
<li>Now slice the strawberries lengthwise and place one on each tart. Using leftover ganache, drizzle each tart.</li>
<li>These pastries are best served cold, right out of the fridge. Enjoy!</li>
