<p>Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, extra fluffy banana pancakes. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>These extra fluffy banana pancakes are the best, and so easy to make you don't even need a mixer! They're the best banana pancakes you will ever eat, and are certain to become a weekend breakfast staple! Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and delicately flavored with bananas and vanilla — these are phenomenal banana pancakes.</p>
<p>Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful. Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have extra fluffy banana pancakes using 11 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-extra-fluffy-banana-pancakes">The ingredients needed to make Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 3 large very ripe bananas</li>
<li>Make ready 2 large eggs</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbs granulated sugar</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Take 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbs unsalted butter - melted</li>
<li>Prepare 1 cup milk</li>
<li>Prepare 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Take 4 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
</ol>
<p>Fluffy, grain-free pancakes that are rich in fiber + protein. For extra-flufiness, I beat the egg yolk and egg whites separately and boy, were these. Fluffy yet moist thanks to mashed banana mixed into the batter, these pancakes make for the perfect weekend morning breakfast. If you over mix, your pancakes will not be nearly as fluffy.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-extra-fluffy-banana-pancakes">Instructions to make Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl mash bananas until slightly liquidy. Add eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
<li>Add melted butter and stir until just combined, then add milk and stir until well combined with all other wet ingredients.</li>
<li>Add flour, baking, powder, and baking soda. Fold into wet ingredients until just combined. You want your batter to be slightly lumpy. Do not over-mix or you'll have tough pancakes.</li>
<li>Let batter rest for 5-10 minutes while you heat a nonstick skillet, iron skillet, or griddle over medium-low heat. When skillet is hot add 1 tsp of butter if desired and let melt (I don't do this but some people do).</li>
<li>For 6 inch pancakes: Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop batter out of bowl and pour into hot skillet. Add as many at one time that you can fit without edges touching (my skillet fits one at a time). For &quot;silver dollar&quot; pancakes scoop 2 tbs of batter per pancake into skillet.</li>
<li>Cook pancakes on first side until bubbles just begin to come through and edges look slightly dry. Flip and cook 1 minute, or until second side is lightly browned. The trick is to cook pancakes at a low temperature so they cook all the way through without burning.</li>
<li>Stack your perfect pancakes on plates and serve with your favorite toppings (I like peanut butter). Can serve 2-8 people depending on how many pancakes you want to give each person. Haha. I was able to get 8, 6 inch pancakes and 2, 4 inch pancakes out of this batch. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Over-mixing your pancake batter will result in tough, rubbery and flat pancakes (boo!!) Ripe bananas! No need for a mixer or special equipment. This recipe is all mixed by hand! If you want to have pancakes ready to go for a quick breakfast on the weekend, or even breakfast for dinner for the family, you can always freeze. These banana pancakes are light and fluffy and perfect with syrup and fresh berries.</p>
