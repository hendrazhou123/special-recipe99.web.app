<p>Hey everyone, hope you&rsquo;re having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, milk gravy w/biscuits. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Use the drippings from making bacon, plus a few simple ingredients, to make a Kentucky-style milk gravy to serve over hot biscuits. I made milk gravy today to put on buscuits. I just put oil in my skillet and put flour in oil and poured milk into it to thicken.</p>
<p>Milk Gravy w/biscuits is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. Milk Gravy w/biscuits is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have milk gravy w/biscuits using 7 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-milk-gravy-wbiscuits">The ingredients needed to make Milk Gravy w/biscuits:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 3 tbsp bacon grease</li>
<li>Take 6 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
<li>Get 4 cup whole milk</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 lb semi crispy, cooked, crumbled bacon</li>
<li>Make ready 1 salt to taste</li>
<li>Make ready 1 pepper to taste</li>
<li>Make ready 6 to 8 biscuits of your choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serve this dish hot for breakfast or with dinner. Vegan biscuits and gravy are made from scratch with cashew milk (almond, oat or your favorite plant milk works too), flour and fat, making them a pantry staple recipe and perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Nothing really compares to homemade biscuits and gravy, so roll up your sleeves and get. American &quot;biscuits&quot;, a staple in Southern cuisine, are similar to scones and are often served with a milk gravy.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-milk-gravy-wbiscuits">Steps to make Milk Gravy w/biscuits:</h5>
<ol>
<li>heat bacon grease in a large skillet until hot.</li>
<li>add flour to the bacon grease and whisk together. keep heating until the flour is nice and browned.</li>
<li>pour in 2 cups of the milk while whisking vigorously. continue to whisk until all lumps are gone.</li>
<li>once its starring to bubble add rest of milk and continue to whisk to make sure it doesn't lump up.</li>
<li>continue to cook and whisk until just before your desired thickness. but remember it does thicken as it cools. salt and pepper to taste once it starts to thicken a bit. you can do a finger test.. dab pinky finger into gravy and taste. add more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
<li>remove from heat. place 2 biscuits on a plate.</li>
<li>pour milk gravy over biscuits.. amount depends on what you like.. but I completely cover mine.</li>
<li>sprinkle crumbled bacon all over the top.</li>
<li>serve hot. great served with my bacon and jelly toasty and my bacon fried eggs! or serve alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Home made biscuits taste better to me, but use what you will. Whisk in milk a half a cup at a time. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Biscuits and gravy is one of my all time favorite breakfast combinations 😀 Some people prefer to cut the biscuits up into bite size pieces Just stir it frequently until it reaches the consistency you like… if it gets too thick too quickly, add a splash of milk. Just pour that gravy alllllllll over the fluffy biscuits!</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up with this exceptional food milk gravy w/biscuits recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I&rsquo;m sure that you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page on your browser, and share it to your family, colleague and friends. Thank you for reading.
