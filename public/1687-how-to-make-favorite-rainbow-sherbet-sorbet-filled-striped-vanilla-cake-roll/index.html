<p>So this is more like a rainbow sorbet then? Not sure, don't think I ever had rainbow sorbet. Sorry, I'm not to good with describing flavors. A bright and colorful rainbow cake roll filled with a whipped rainbow chip frosting filling. When adding stripes of cake batter, it's ok to leave small spaces in between colors, as batter will fill in during baking.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up with this special food rainbow sherbet ( sorbet ) filled striped vanilla cake roll recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am confident you can make this at home. There is gonna be more interesting food in home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
