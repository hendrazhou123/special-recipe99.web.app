<li>If dough is sticky, add a couple tablespoons of flour until no longer sticky. Add couple drops of water if to dry.</li>
<li>Oil a large bowl and roll dough around to cover. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until double in size.</li>
<li>Punch down dough. On floured surface, roll out dough into 9x13 rectangle.</li>
<li>Mix softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon until a creamy paste and well combined.</li>
<li>Spread filling generously onto dough leaving 1 inch edge at one end. This helps to seal edges by leaving off the filling.</li>
<li>Starting with long edge, roll tightly in jelly roll fashion.</li>
<li>When you get to opposite edge, pull dough up and pinch to seal together. Pinch and tuck in ends also.</li>
<li>With serated knife, pizza cutter or dental floss, cut rolls into 12 to 15 pieces.</li>
<li>Place rolls touching each other in oiled 9x13 baking dish.</li>
<li>If you want bigger rolls, cut wider slices and you can also roll out dough bigger to make more rolls before filling.</li>
<li>Cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rise in warm place until double in size.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350. Bake rolls 15 to 20 minutes or until set in center. Cover with foil if browing to fast after 15 minutes.</li>
<li>While rolls are baking, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, butter and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. If to thick, add little splash of milk to thin slightly.</li>
<li>Spread half of the icing over hot rolls as soon as they come out of oven. This melts into nooks and crannies and is delicious!</li>
<li>When slightly cooled but still warm, spread the rest of icing over warm rolls.</li>
<li>I hope you enjoy these as much as I do :)</li>
