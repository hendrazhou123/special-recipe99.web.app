<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, best apple muffins recipe. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Best Apple Muffins Recipe is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful. Best Apple Muffins Recipe is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>These apple muffins taste even better after resting for a few hours, if they last that long. I particularly enjoy them with a spread of peanut butter. Check my recipe notes for how to use honey instead of maple syrup, and some ideas for how to make the muffins vegan.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook best apple muffins recipe using 11 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-best-apple-muffins-recipe">The ingredients needed to make Best Apple Muffins Recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Get 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>Get 3 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready 1 pinch salt</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>Get 3 tbsp melted butter</li>
<li>Get 2 medium eggs</li>
<li>Prepare 3/4 cup whole milk (or equal parts evaporated milk and water)</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>Prepare 2 large apples</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
</ol>
<p>Delicious muffins bursting with apple pieces are perfect for a grab-and-go breakfast, for a healthy addition to a bag lunch, with a coffee of tea for an afternoon snack, or simply for an energy boost during your busy day! I got this recipe from a friend. I make these often and take them to many potlucks, office parties, the cottage, picnics, children's lunch and the list goes on. Made without oil or butter, these oat muffins are great for a healthy grab-and-go breakfast.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-best-apple-muffins-recipe">Steps to make Best Apple Muffins Recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>First, peel and core the apples, then cube them. Transfer to a bowl and add in the cinnamon and mix thoroughly till all the apple cubes are coated in cinnamon.</li>
<li>Next, mix together all the dry ingredients in a separate large mixing bowl. In another bowl or measuring cup, mix together all the wet ingredients and whisk thoroughly to combine.</li>
<li>Then in the bowl of the dry ingredients, add in the wet ingredients and mix with a spatula just until well combined, making sure there are no lumps. After, fold in the apples just until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Let the muffin batter rest for a while but in the meantime, grease a muffin pan with butter, I like to grease the entire pan, so when the muffins puff up, they don't stick to the edges of the pan. Pre heat your oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit for about 7 - 10 minutes to get the oven hot enough.</li>
<li>While you wait for your oven to preheat, fill your muffin pan with the muffin batter.</li>
<li>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven on the middle rack for about 30 minutes, till a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the muffins brown. Baking time may vary. Let cool for about 5 minutes in the pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely or enjoy them warm. This muffin batter keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days, baking instructions stay the same.</li>
<li>If making a mug cake, pour in a medium sized mug about 5 heaped tbsp of the muffin batter and microwave for about 1 minute 30 secs, if a toothpick inserted doesn't come out clean, microwave another 30 seconds but using 10 second intervals just in case they cook faster. Over microwaving will cause your muffin to be rubbery. Happy baking!</li>
</ol>
