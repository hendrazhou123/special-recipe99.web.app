<li>Pour it into a small pot and heat it on low heat. Heat it until white foam disappears and it gets thickened lightly. Strain it and let it cool in ice water. Add vanilla essence to the cold sauce and mix well. Let it sit in a fridge.</li>
<li>Take the pudding out of the small bowl. Put the bowl in hot water for a few seconds. Put a dish on the top and turn upside down.</li>
<li>Lift the bowl slowly.</li>
<li>Put the anglaise sause around the pudding. It's all done!</li>
</ol>
<p>If pudding is thicker than you prefer, add a tablespoon of almond milk at a time. So happy to find this alternative recipe because I only buy Almond milk anymore!! Blancmange (blawnh-MAHNZH), a French favorite, is a cooked pudding that's poured into individual ramekins and chilled. Strain through a sieve into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Try an iconic almond milk pudding recipe that uses almond milk and adds a tasty fruit topping.</p>
