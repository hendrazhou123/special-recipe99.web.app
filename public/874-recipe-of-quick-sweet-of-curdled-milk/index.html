<p>Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, sweet of curdled milk. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Amamma Recipe #Junnu #CookatHome Recipe #curdled #milk Fresh milk when boiled, starts to separate from its water content. The curdled milk will have lumps of milk protein, in greenish water which was once smooth, creamy milk. But curdled milk is not always a bad thing though it is an Lactic acid bacteria, Proteolytic bacteria, Lipolytic bacteria, gas producing microorganisms, Ropy bacteria and sweet curling bacteria.</p>
<p>Sweet of Curdled Milk is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. It&rsquo;s simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. Sweet of Curdled Milk is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have sweet of curdled milk using 4 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-sweet-of-curdled-milk">The ingredients needed to make Sweet of Curdled Milk:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 1/2 Gallon Pausterized Milk</li>
<li>Make ready 1.5 Cups Brown Sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 6 tablespoons lemon juice (or 2-3 lemons to squeeze)</li>
<li>Make ready  Lemon peel (just grate the peel of half a lemon)</li>
</ol>
<p>Milk is comprised of several compounds, primarily fat, protein, and sugar. The protein in milk is normally suspended in a colloidal solution. Sour milk not curdled milk can be used only by. Curdled milk will upset your stomach if you drink it straight, but it actually serves a variety of culinary purposes, so knowing how to curdle milk is a skill that can come in handy in the kitchen.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-sweet-of-curdled-milk">Steps to make Sweet of Curdled Milk:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Put the milk on a cooking pot on medium-low heat</li>
<li>Add the sugar and stir vigorously</li>
<li>Add the lemon peel and let it sit for 2-3 minutes</li>
<li>Once the milk is closer to boiling point (@ 170°-180° F), add the lemon juice</li>
<li>If you want small curds, start stiring slowly right away&hellip; if you want larger curds, start stiring after 5 minutes of adding the lemon juice&hellip; in any case, you can press the curds against the cooking pot to break them if they are too large</li>
<li>Now wait for about 2-3 hours, slowly stiring from time to time, until most of the whey evaporates to the point where the whey barely covers all the curds. You'll want to keep some whey because it will be reabsorbed once the sweet is refrigerated and it might become too dry unless you leave enough whey before storing it.</li>
<li>Store in the refrigerator and enjoy cold</li>
</ol>
<p>Put your cold milk in an aluminum pot. Sweet curdling could be caused by growth of spores that were not killed during sterilisation. Bacillus cereus spores commonly causes this issue later in shelf life. If the milk is fresh, then keeping it in the refrigerator is sufficient to prevent the milk from curdling. The milk becomes curdled when mixed with the acidic stomach fluid.</p>
