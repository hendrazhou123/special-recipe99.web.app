If it's still as liquid as when it was warm. This chocolate ganache frosting is thick enough to filll a cake, or frost a cake just like buttercream! I've worked a lot with chocolate ganache, but mainly for drip cakes! When I decided I wanted to cover a cake in ganache, I knew the ratios of heavy cream to chocolate would have to.</p>
