<li>The result after baking.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm such a brutally scary stalker fan of coffee flavour, particularly Vietnamese style coffee - dark roast coffee dripping on top of a sweet and saucy thick pile of sweetened condensed milk, set over ice so it gets all melty, milky. This sweetened condensed milk pound cake is moist, dense and lightly sweet. It's perfect served for breakfast (along with some delicious Millstone Coffee of course!) - and it's also wonderful served for dessert with fruit or any other kind of sweet topping. What is your favorite everyday cake? It brings me joy enjoying a slice of pound cake with a cup of a hot tea or hot coffee.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up for this exceptional food coffee condense milk cake recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I&rsquo;m sure that you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
