<p>Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, chocolate pound cake. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>A dense chocolate cake made in a Bundt pan. Dust with confectioners' sugar for a nice presentation. This Chocolate Pound Cake gets its chocolate flavor from unsweetened cocoa powder.</p>
<p>Chocolate Pound Cake is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. Chocolate Pound Cake is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook chocolate pound cake using 11 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-chocolate-pound-cake">The ingredients needed to make Chocolate Pound Cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 100 g unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
<li>Make ready 100 g granulated sugar</li>
<li>Take 100 g egg (from 2 medium-size eggs), room temperature</li>
<li>Take 80 g cake flour</li>
<li>Take 12 g natural cocoa powder</li>
<li>Prepare 2 g (1/2 tsp) baking powder</li>
<li>Prepare 0.75 g (1/8 tsp) table salt</li>
<li>Get 30 ml milk</li>
<li>Get 4 g instant coffee</li>
<li>Get 28 g chocolate</li>
<li>Make ready  icing sugar for dusting (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>This Chocolate Pound Cake is dense, buttery and loaded with rich chocolate flavor. While I love a regular pound cake, I might not ever go back now that I've had this amazing chocolate version. Chocolate pound cake comes together so easily that it's an everyday cake, but the taste and texture — that close-knit, tight crumb unique to a pound cake — plus the deep chocolate flavor make it feel. This decadent Chocolate Pound Cake is rich, moist, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious!</p>

<ol>
<li>Youtu.be/kSmENw547Mw</li>
<li>Heat milk, instant coffee, and chocolate until fully melted and stir to combine. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Using a hand mixer or simply a hand-whisk, cream the butter for 1 minute until fully-softened. Add sugar and beat until fluffy and lightened in color. Frequently scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula for even mix.</li>
<li>Lightly beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Then add them into the butter mixture in 3 additions. Mix just until combined after every addition. If we add all eggs at once, both of these high-fat ingredients might not combine but end up separating.</li>
<li>Add all of the dry ingredients. Make sure to sieve the flour, baking powder, and cocoa powder beforehand as they tend to clump. Mix until 90% combined.</li>
<li>Add the melted chocolate. Mix just until combined. Do not overmix as it will develop the gluten too much and result in a tough cake.</li>
<li>Transfer into a loaf pan that has been fully coated with butter. This will help unmold the cake easily.</li>
<li>Spread up the batter to both ends of the pan. Pipe a line of softened butter along the center lengthwise. These steps are optional, but they will help create an evenly-centered crack.</li>
<li>Bake in a preheated oven at 340°F (170°C) for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
<li>Run a spatula between the cake and the pan. Unmold the cake immediately after baking to prevent shrinking. Let cool on the cooling rack. With a sifter, garnish the top with icing sugar before slicing (optional).</li>
